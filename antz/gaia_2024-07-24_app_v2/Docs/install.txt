install.txt 2024-02-10

Generally you can just run the app (without any install).

Typically, you will need to explicitly authorize the app
when prompted by a MS Windows warning dialog.

Also, some Windows systems will report a mssing 'MSVCR120.dll'
in which case, install 'vcredist_x86.exe' located with the app.
