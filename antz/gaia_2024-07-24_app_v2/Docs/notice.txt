3RD PARTY LIBRARY LICENSING
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd party libraries have their own licenses. In general we attempt to only
include libraries that are compatible with both open source projects and 
commercial solutions. However, separate licensing from our vendors is often
required for hardware device support (XR, video IO, etc.), optional software
features (eg. databases such as MySQL, OmniSci, etc.) and data (eg. maps).

You are responsible for all licensing terms specific to your use case.
