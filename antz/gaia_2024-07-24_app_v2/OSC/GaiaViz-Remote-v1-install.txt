GaiaViz Remote v1 provides an easy and fun way to explore the new spiral topo
using a mobile device as a remote control over your local network.

Step 1: Get the IP address of your computer, either:
  - Run 'ipconfig' from the OS command prompt.
  - Start -> Settings -> Network & Internet -> Status -> Properties
    (...scroll down to see the IPv4 address).

Step 2: Set up GaiaViz Remote on your phone/tablet:
  - Install TouchOSC on your device:
      https://hexler.net/touchosc/#get
  - From your email (on the device) open the attachment (choose TouchOSC):
      GaiaViz-RemoteV1.tosc
  - Slide the top menubar (from right to left) to find the link icon.
    - Enable OSC -> Connexion 1 (UDP) and set:
        - Port: 8000
        - IP: your computer's IPv4 address
  - Press the play icon in the top menubar to start sending OSC commands.

Step 3: Set rx_port to 8000 in the GaiaViz global table:
  - './User/_Global_/csv/np_globals.csv' 
    - (row) 18,"np_osc",1,"rx_port","i",8000,"","","0"

Step 4: Run GaiaViz and press 1 to load sample spirals or 4 key for ImageViz.

Tips:

On app launch, if Windows Defender Firewall pops up:
  - Check both boxes (Private & Public networks...)
  - Click [Allow access]

The GaiaViz 'rx_port' is set in 'Users/_Global_/csv/np_globals.csv', which
can be changed (or set to 0) to run concurrent copies of the app.

You can see the raw OSC commands in the GaiaViz system console window.
